Gamification as an Optional Tool to Enhance Data Quality?

After wrapping up the PSI Trail project and seeing how much fun it brought to the welcome day at PSI, I couldn’t let go of the idea right away.

I’m not with PSI anymore, though. These days, I work for a small executive search boutique with just a few dozen employees.

At first, in a wave of nostalgia, I thought: why not organize a similar scavenger hunt here? Could be fun! But with only about 8 new hires per year, that might be… a bit much.

The Gamification Bug Stuck With Me
Even after shelving the idea of a scavenger hunt, the gamification bug stayed in my head.

A quick bit of research (really quick, I admit) showed that there’s actually some interesting work out there about using gamification in HR — especially for onboarding or staying in touch with new hires between contract signing and their first day.

Most of these ideas involve tools — apps, platforms, e-learning systems. And while I love the idea of engaging new hires early and even using VR in onboarding, I don’t think that’s where my current company is heading. At least not yet.

A New Use Case: Data Quality
But then I had another thought.
Instead of focusing on candidates or clients, what if we used gamification internally — to improve data quality in our CRM?

Let’s face it:
The heart of executive search is the contact to people — candidates and clients alike. But to make that contact meaningful, we need to remember things:

Who we talked to
About what
When
And why
To do that, we rely on our CRM.
If the personal contact is the heartbeat, then the CRM is the bloodstream — circulating vital information through the entire organization.

And yet, let’s be honest:
Maintaining data quality? It’s tedious. It’s time-consuming. And (dare I say it?) not exactly the sexiest part of our job.

So Here’s My Idea
Why not build a little gamified intro to the CRM system for new colleagues?
Something that helps them figure out how to navigate the data jungle in an effective, efficient way.

And then — step two — why not create small challenges for everyone on the team? Something like a “CRM Clean-Up Bingo” or weekly mini-challenges that prompt us to revisit entries, spot inconsistencies, or just refresh our memory.

Wouldn’t that improve data quality in three ways?

Alignment — Everyone follows the same rules for entering names, titles, contact details, etc.
Awareness — We all start caring (a little more) about data quality.
Efficiency — Entering and using the data becomes easier for everyone.
What Do You Think?
This might be small. It might even sound a bit silly. But maybe that’s exactly why it could work.
