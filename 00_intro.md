From Joke to Onboarding Tool: How the PSI Trail Became a Lasting Experience

It started with a joke — and the need to redesign the onboarding walk across the PSI campus. Due to its nuclear research facilities, the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) requires all new employees to take a guided tour of the premises. The aim: to make them aware of essential safety features like defibrillators, fire extinguishers, and emergency exits.

But how do you keep people open and engaged during yet another structured activity after a long onboarding day full of new impressions and socializing? And how do you ensure that they retain what actually matters — like safety?

The PhD Coffee Break That Sparked the Idea
Over a casual coffee, a PhD student shared their own experience of joining PSI. For newcomers, especially young researchers, the setting can be overwhelming: a research facility spread across 48 soccer fields, with over 120 buildings, tight security protocols, and a mix of high-end science and everyday admin processes.

In that conversation, we toyed with the idea of creating a kind of scavenger hunt — playful, interactive, memorable. But doubts arose: would researchers even have time or interest? Would they find it silly? The idea was dismissed — at first.

Yet a few coffee breaks later, the idea returned. This time with a smile and growing conviction: maybe this could work.

Testing the Concept — No Budget, No Problem
With no official budget and a very pragmatic mindset, we decided to test the idea. The HR team — happy to let go of the dry “security walk” format — was immediately supportive.

Inspired by the popular Swiss “Foxtrails” (https://foxtrail.ch), we set out to design a station-based walk with puzzles. The concept: around 10 stations, each with a multiple-choice question. A correct answer leads you to the next station; a wrong answer takes you on a detour or slows you down.

To avoid losing staff in the wilds of PSI, we included safety nets — such as hint cards — and involved HR operations early on to meet legal and security standards.

From Plastic Boxes to Tablets: Scaling the Trail
The first trial run involved volunteers from the HR department. Early in the morning, plastic boxes with envelopes were hidden around the site — each containing clues and next steps.

The feedback from new employees was enthusiastic. What they loved most? The “Trail Finisher Diploma” they received at the end — a small but meaningful touch. It became a ceremonial moment, also serving as a headcount check to ensure everyone made it back.

But we knew the boxes weren’t a long-term solution. So we brought in the apprentice team to help digitize the trail. They built a protected website (almost like an app), where all content could be accessed via tablet.

After months of coding, testing, adjusting, and even involving the communications department to design giant posters with QR codes, PSI Trail 2.0 was born.

Culture Through Play: What I Learned
Today, the Trail is an integral part of every official welcome day at PSI. All new employees take part in it — regardless of role or department — as part of their mandatory onboarding. Thanks to leadership support, we were able to buy weatherproof display cases to house the QR posters. The HR department updates and charges the tablets regularly, keeping things smooth and sustainable.

Looking back, it’s fascinating to see how something playful, improvised, and low-budget grew into a cultural anchor. Having one person own the process helped keep momentum and consistency. And while involving apprentices was great, I learned that their school-related workload often left less room for side projects than expected.

Final Thought
Sometimes, the most lasting projects don’t begin with a PowerPoint or a project plan — but with a coffee and a laugh. The PSI Trail reminds me that creativity, trust, and just starting somewhere can go a long way.
