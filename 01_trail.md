Gamification in HR — Walking Through the Doors (Part 1/4)
Three Doors and a Prejudice: Why Gamification Is More Than Roleplay and Rankings

This article is Part 1 of my four-part series “Gamification in HR — Walking Through the Doors”, exploring common pitfalls and perspectives around playful approaches in the workplace.

Gamification in HR is a polarizing concept. At first, it sounds fun — playful, even — but it often assumes something that’s missing: voluntariness. Not everyone enjoys playing. And when playful elements are introduced too forcefully, they can leave employees cold — or even resistant. At the same time, competitive personalities might start “optimizing the system” rather than truly engaging with the process.

Wait… Do I Really Have to Play?
A comment I received on one of my LinkedIn posts (Gamification as an Optional Tool to Enhance Data) got me thinking:
Will people try to trick any technical solution just to improve their standing — especially in a new company?
And how would I feel if I had to join a “voluntary” roleplay on my very first day in a new job? Honestly, it makes me shiver just thinking about it.

In this series, I invite you to walk through three symbolic doors — each one representing a common pitfall or misconception of gamification in HR: forced participation, overemphasis on competition, and shallow game mechanics. Along the way, I’ll share my own doubts and explore how gamified tools can be designed to respect autonomy, foster inclusion, and encourage real engagement — not just performance for performance’s sake.

What If You’re Just Not the Competitive Type?
As part of this little deep dive, I’ve also talked to peers, friends, and family. Most of them are still part of the workforce and have gone through job changes recently. So, I asked them what they think about gamified onboarding tools like the PSI Trail. These conversations — and also my own imagined scenarios — often bring up the same skeptical or uncomfortable feelings.

Some feel uneasy about showing their personality in a roleplay on their very first day. Others wonder how they’re supposed to “win” against someone who’s already worked at the company in another role — or who simply knows someone on the inside. That feeling of “already having lost” before even starting? It’s real.

And this shows me that even cool, well-intentioned onboarding tools — like the PSI Trail — come with potential pitfalls. So let’s take a closer look at three aspects of gamification we should always keep in mind when designing onboarding experiences:

Door 1: Feeling pressured to participate in something you generally dislike (e.g. roleplay)
Door 2: Winning shouldn’t be everything — employee engagement isn’t built on rankings
Door 3: Engagement beyond onboarding — choose your design wisely
Stay tuned for Part 2, where I explore what happens when participation isn’t really optional.
