# Gamification in HR: How to Engage Without Excluding
Door 2: Winning shouldn’t be everything — employee engagement isn’t built on rankings

In this series on Gamification in HR, I explore three different “doors” — three perspectives on how game-inspired elements can shape employee engagement. If you’ve read the first two parts, you’ve already stepped through the intro and the first door. Now we open Door 2, where things get a little more competitive.

“Winning shouldn’t be everything — employee engagement isn’t built on rankings.”

That’s the teaser I left at the end of the first article. In this piece, I’ll explore what that idea looks like in practice. What happens when gamification introduces competition at work? And how can we avoid turning a well-intended initiative into a source of pressure — or even frustration?

Introducing competition in the workplace can energize some employees — let’s call them the strivers. But others may find it demotivating or even alienating — let’s call them the shapers. When using gamification in a professional setting, especially within HR, how do we strike a balance between these two groups?

Gamification can be a powerful tool, not just for onboarding, but also for drawing attention to tasks that are often perceived as tedious or secondary. Take, for instance, the topic of compliance: handling, storing, and sending employee data in accordance with privacy regulations. There are legal requirements about which HR-related data can be stored during active employment, who can access it, and for how long it can be retained after an employee leaves.

To make this topic both engaging and instructive, I’ve developed an e-learning module. My idea was to enhance it by turning it into a lighthearted competition: those who complete the module diligently and answer the final quiz questions correctly within a certain time frame will win a small, but attractive, prize. The goal is to foster momentum and encourage everyone to participate — but will it work for all?

Let’s return to our two groups:

The strivers feel motivated. They will likely dive into the training early, stay focused, and aim to submit the top result first — all with the prize in mind.

The shapers may feel unsure. Why should there be a competition for a compliance topic? Some might even perceive it as unfair to be evaluated on something they consider peripheral to their work. Yet — if they’re being honest — they’d also like to win something.

So how do we create a gamified experience that energizes without excluding?

Personally, I would start by asking: Why am I introducing a competition in the first place? My answer: I want to make sure all employees — even those less interested in the topic — complete the training thoroughly and efficiently. The challenge, then, is to design a competition that appeals to different motivational profiles.

Could the prize be awarded to teams instead of individuals?
Could everyone who completes the e-learning successfully enter a raffle, regardless of their score or submission time?

These considerations remind me once again that gamification in HR holds great potential — especially when it comes to motivating those who might otherwise stay on the sidelines. But success depends heavily on understanding your audience. Keeping your employees’ mindsets and behaviors front and center ensures that your efforts won’t fizzle out but instead generate a positive dynamic.

One final note: Internal communication plays a crucial role in this process. I’ll share more of my thoughts on that in the next article.
