# *Gamification beyond onboarding? Let’s not play it wrong.*

So far, I haven’t come across too much gamification in HR processes.  
Maybe my work environment is more old-school than I thought?  
Or maybe it's just not as widespread yet.

Either way, I’ve been playing around with a little thought experiment:

> *What if we designed HR processes like games? Where's the tipping point — the moment a game loses its charm?*  
> When does an employee click the game off instead of completing it?  
> And when does the smile on the employer’s face fade, because what once felt fresh now feels forced?

From a user’s perspective (and to be clear: this is theory, not tested in the field), I believe there are **three key ingredients** that make or break the gamification magic:

---

## 1. What’s the game actually *for*?

Is it worth wrapping a process in game mechanics at all?  
What’s the objective — and is the gameplay really the best way to reach it?

If the purpose isn’t clear, or the benefit too small, it might just be bells and whistles.  
Not every process needs fireworks.

## 2. How often do you expect people to “play”?

Even the most creative design loses power if it’s overused.

Different player types respond differently — some might love monthly mini-games, others (like me) prefer rare but strategic gameplay.  
One person’s fun is another’s skip-button.

So: How often is *too* often?

## 3. Can you measure what matters?

Let’s say you build a game to improve cross-team communication.  
After a year, how do you know it worked?

If there’s no way to see whether behaviors have changed, the effort might be more fun than fruitful.  
Cool design is great — but measurable change is better.

## Wrapping up the thought experiment

Gamification sounds great — and it *can* be —  
but only if you design it wisely.

Think about the **goal**, the **frequency**, and the **measurability**.  
Otherwise, what starts as play could turn into just another process people want to click away.
