# Professional Etiquette Isn’t Old-Fashioned — It’s a Signal of Respect  
*What we can still learn from our grandparents when navigating modern job applications*

In Executive Search, I deal with many candidates. And more often than you'd expect, I find myself thinking: even in times of AI, email, and social media, we could all take a cue from our grandparents’ behaviour — because it still counts.

This article isn’t about whether cover letters are outdated or how frustrating it is that LinkedIn’s “Easy Apply” still makes you type in your entire career history (which really sucks if you’ve had more than two jobs). It’s about something more fundamental: the way we engage with a potential new employer.

Of course, we’re not living in the 1970s anymore. But I sometimes wonder if basic courtesy disappeared the moment smartphones and laptops became standard tools.

Take this simple example:  
After an interview, I don’t expect a call or a long message. But a short follow-up — a quick “Hej, I had a good talk and I’m still interested in the role” — goes a long way.

Whenever I schedule interviews, I ask candidates to send a brief note afterwards. When we meet in person, I often suggest they sleep on it and share their impressions the next day. It's a way to acknowledge the conversation and signal continued interest — or not, which is equally valid.

From my side, I do the same: I confirm interviews promptly, and after attending one myself, I always thank the organizers and share a short reflection. That’s how I was taught — and how I still operate today. Respectful. Reliable. Human.

This kind of professional etiquette isn’t old-fashioned. It shows initiative and appreciation, two things that still matter in today’s fast-paced work environment.

**So here’s my tip:**  
If you’re seriously considering a role, show it. A short thank-you or confirmation message won’t cost you much — but it might leave a lasting impression.
