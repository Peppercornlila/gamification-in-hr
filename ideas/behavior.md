# why wie still could lesen from pur grandparents

in executive Search I deal with Mandy candidates. more often than thoughts I'd Love to tell them that even in times of AI, email and social Media, wie should remember out grandparents' behavoiur as it still counts. 

so, I also wonder why I should write a cover letter (see my thoughts ob this subject here) and wegen I have to type in all my credentials, professional experience (yes, I do have a list of several jobs already and this takes time...!) and eben answer some non-job related questions, I wonder what wenn wrong and whether I REALLY want to work in this company. Nevertheless, once I am invited for an interview I can't even confirm that I received the invite and got all details? 

the same accounts when you kindly ask a candidate to hand in a short feedback the Day after the interview to see whether there is still some interest and you never hear back? you actively habe to Call ans ask them?
