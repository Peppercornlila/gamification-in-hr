The Fancier, the Better? Not Always.
Think you need a new tool to improve your workflow? Sometimes, what's already on your desktop is enough.

Does it always have to be a super fancy tool?
Does something shiny and new really support you better in your daily tasks?

Sure — it feels great to press one button and get the perfect report: clean layout, solid numbers, data that speaks for itself. But what if your employer isn’t willing to invest in such a tool? Or what if that tool simply doesn’t exist?

Today, more people than ever — sometimes with the help of AI — are creating their own tools, tailored exactly to their needs. But does it always have to be something new? What about what we already have?

Let’s talk about the classics: Microsoft Office.
I know — Word, Excel & Co. might not sound like the go-to solution when you want to streamline a process. But sometimes, these old companions still have a few surprises in store.

A Real-World Frustration

Not long ago, I found myself stuck with a fundamental, recurring task at work. It wasn’t rocket science, but it was time-consuming and frustrating. Every time I did it, it felt like I lost an hour of my day (maybe it wasn’t that long — but still too long).

Since our company doesn’t have a specialized tool for every single task, and we still rely on Word and Excel quite a bit, I decided to stop waiting for a better solution and improve what I had.

Now, I’m not a full-on programmer. I have some basic technical skills and curiosity — and I had AI to help me along the way.

Building My Own Mini-Tool

First, I asked myself:
What exactly is the part of the task that eats up the most time?

In my case, it was switching between Word and Outlook and manually counting working days and calendar weeks. Our project plans follow a fixed rhythm for each phase — Phase A = X days, Phase B = Y weeks, etc.

I started imagining a simple tool that could generate a standard 3-month project plan, based on a given starting date and week.

Turns out, Excel can do a lot with the right formulas.
So I built a spreadsheet where each cell references another — dates, weeks, milestones. It wasn’t fancy, but it worked.

It took time. I worked on it in the evenings, refining formulas, adjusting prompts, testing results, solving one hiccup only to uncover another. But in the end, I had something that worked. And it felt really good.

But I Didn’t Stop There

Then came the next realization:
What if someone accidentally overwrites a formula in the Excel file?
And what if — as in our internal process — the official project plan needs to be in Word format anyway?

That’s when I remembered something from earlier in my career: the old trick of using mail merge to link Excel data with a Word template. (Who else remembers doing serial letters that way?)

This time, I didn’t even need AI. I created a Word template that mirrors the layout and structure of our project plan, using placeholders for all the milestones. Now, once the plan is generated in Excel, I link it to Word, save the final version as a clean document, and we’re good to go — even for further editing or timeline changes.

Why I’d Do It Again

Sure, you could argue this would’ve been faster with MS Project or another fancy tool.
But honestly? I prefer this solution.

I’ve learned a lot — from defining the problem, creating and testing my own logic, to seeing what’s actually possible within Office programs, even at a basic level. I avoided pushing for an expensive new tool and made the most of what was already available.

And who knows — maybe I’ll even show some younger colleagues that these “old” programs aren’t so outdated after all.

Takeaway:
Sometimes, it’s not about the fanciest solution. It’s about taking ownership, using what you have, and daring to build something better — one formula at a time.
