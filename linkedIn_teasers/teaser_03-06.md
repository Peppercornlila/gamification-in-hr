👀 Ever silently wished you could skip a “fun” activity at work?
A roleplay? A team game? An onboarding challenge?

You’re not alone.

🚪 In Part 2 of my series on Gamification in HR, I explore Door 1 – the pressure to participate in something you don’t feel like doing.
Especially when saying no isn’t really an option.

✨ Inspired by your feedback on my last post and personal conversations, this article takes a closer look at the thin line between inclusion and overload – and why not everyone wants to “win” on day one.

🌍 In diverse, global teams, well-meant games can feel very different depending on background, personality and context. So how do we keep it welcoming?

Would love to hear your thoughts:
Have you ever felt out of place in a supposedly “fun” activity?
Or found your own quiet way of being part of it?
